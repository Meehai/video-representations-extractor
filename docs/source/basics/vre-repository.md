### VRE Repository

VRE has a built-in representations repository of various ported algorithms and ML models. See
[here](vre_repository/__init__.py) the list of these built-in representations.

Weights are stored in this directory using `git-lfs`: [weights dir](./resources/weights/).

Note: If you just want to clone the repo, without the weights resources, use `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone ...`.
See below other installation options, like pip (recommended) or docker.
